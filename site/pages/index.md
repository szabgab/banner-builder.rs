The goal is to create a library that will make it easy to create various simple banners for YouTube, Meetup, and also for the Code Maven SSG.

## Use as a command line tool:

### Install as a CLI tool

If you have Rust on your system you can type in the following command:

```
cargo install banner-builder
```

If you don't have Rust, we'll supply a pre-compiled binary. TODO

### Use as a CLI tool:

Create a YAML file based on the example found on the [web site](https://banner-builder.code-maven.com/)

Run the command supplying the path to the YAML file and the path to the image you'd like to generate:

```
banbu hello_world.yaml hello_world.png
```

## Examples

### Hello World

{% include file="examples/hello_world.yaml" %}

```
banbu site/examples/hello_world.yaml hello_world.png
```

![](examples/hello_world.png)


### YouTube Thumbnail

{% include file="examples/youtube_thumbnail_text_background.yaml" %}

![](examples/youtube_thumbnail_text_background.png)


### Wrap long text

{% include file="examples/wrap_text.yaml" %}

![](examples/wrap_text.png)

## Embed images

{% include file="examples/embed_image.yaml" %}

![](examples/embed_image.png)

## Add text with location (lines)

{% include file="examples/lines.yaml" %}

![](examples/lines.png)

## Banners generated by DEV.to are 1000x500 pixel


Some other banners I saw on Facebook and LinkedIn:

* 1000x500
* 800x400
* 500x300
